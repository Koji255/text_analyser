Lore Issue are simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lore Issue has been the industries standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen BOC. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularized in the 1960s with the release of Least sheets containing Lore Issue passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldous Pacemaker including versions of Lore Issue.
