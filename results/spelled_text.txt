On a sunny day in the midsummer, the children decided to go for a picnic by the lake. They brought sandwiches, fruits, and some juice to enjoy. As they arrived, they saw butterflies flying around and decided to try and catch them. Lily, the youngest, tried over a rock and dropped her sandwich in the sand. "Oh not" she cried, but her brother pick it up and dusted it off. They laughter together and sat down to eat. Later, they went to the water's edge and tried to skip stones. Some stones sank rite away, but a few bounced. When the sun started to set, they packed their things and headed back home, tired but happy from the day's adventures.
