On a sunny day in the midsumer, the childrens decided to go for a picknick by the lake. They brouhgt sandwiches, fruts, and some juce to enjoy. As they arived, they saw buterflies flying around and decieded to try and catch them. Lily, the yungest, triped over a rock and droped her sandwich in the sand. "Oh no," she cried, but her brother pickt it up and dusted it off. They laughted together and sat down to eat. Later, they went to the water's egde and tried to skip stones. Some stones sank rite away, but a few bounced. When the sun startted to set, they packed their things and heded back home, tired but hapy from the day's adventures.
